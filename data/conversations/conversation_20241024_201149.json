But I can tell you that there are no \"right\" or \"wrong\" answers when it comes to favorite colors - everyone's preferences are unique!\n\nIf you'd like, we could play a game where I give you some popular color options and you can choose one that resonates with you. Alternatively, feel free to share your favorite color with me if you're willing to do so!"
